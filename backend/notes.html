<!-- Make a repositery on GIThub and copy the http/SSH key and paste within cloning command

Take a clone on your system in the folder where you want to kept the project and write the following command

git clone <paste the key here></paste>

After clonning the repo make folders at that location

1.baackend
2.frontend

Now, open backend folder in VScode and initialize project and make pakage.json file by following command

npm init -y

then connect to express server and run the following command 
 
npm install express/npm i express

Which creates nodemodules, package-lock.json 

Now, create server.js and show "hello world" msg through server from express.js site

Important Note!
Whenever you make any change in any file it terminates the server and you have start again by "node server.js"

To get rid of it run command: npm i -D nodemon(-D is because we have installing it for development purpose)

Change Scripts in package.json 

"dev": "nodemon server.js",
"start":"node server.js"(This command runs when we deploye our app and nomore changes required)

Connect MongoDB

run command: npm i mongoose(mongoose is an ORM which communicates to MongoDB)

For Validation
npm i joi

For password hashing
 
npm i bcryptjs 

To filter data and view selected data from an object we have used DTO(Data Transfer Object) as  class i.e:UserDTO

                                 JWT Token

We have used JWT(Json Web Authentication)token, to secure authentincation and only restricted user can access his desired content

JWT has 3 parts(header, payload and signture) which contains its configuration details
It contains information about encryption algorithm and type of token and our desired information in payload like: user_id, expiry date etc. signature is used for verification

A secret key is generated at server side, and sign through JWT key also verifys through same key. 

To install JWT token use command
npm i jsonwebtoken

To generate access_token use 'crypto'. By default 'node' has 'crypto'. Use the following command:

Open terminale type 'node' press enter

>const crypto.randomBytes(64).toString('hex') press enter , the key will be generated

Here we'll not send token in Json body but send in cookie becuse its more secure
To Install cookie
>npm i cookie-parser
